If you have ideas, email them to me at avery98@pm.me. Who knows? Maybe your idea
will make it in the next version of Lines!

=================================
2.x
=================================

v2.0:
    Before getting to the actual changes, I want to thank everyone for
    supporting me with this calculator. THANK YOU SO MUCH!!!

    Also, compared to the very first version and the original version of
    libcalc, this is probably the best version yet. In fact, now the
    name "Lines" goes well with the app itself and the code base!
    
    I also removed the add(), subtract(), round_number(), divide(), multiply(),
    and more functions. There was no point in creating these functions in the
    first place. Plus, experimental Pythagorean theorm calculation support has
    been removed because Lines does not calculate anything related to the
    Pythagorean Theorem or triangles.

    This changelog may not be accurate for this version.
    There were so many changes that I couldn't keep track of them all.
    Some time I'll learn how to use use Git. Hopefully that changes
    things.

    Due to an issue that I thought had to do with Lines
    but wasn't the cause, and due to lack of time, I've added some
    incomplete features. You'll see these features complete in a future
    release, maybe 2.1 or 2.2. Something like that.

    One more thing: If you've looked at the code in lines.hpp, you'll notice
    that the options() function is SUPER long. The way Lines handles commands is
    better than v1.2.1, but it can be better. I'm planning to make command
    handling even better in future versions of Lines, so that way
    void options(string option) can stop giving me a headache because that's too
    long! It'll be beneficial with other functions as well.

    Now for the release notes:

    * Updated liblines (formerly libcalc) to version 2.0
      - Code cleanups:

        + Removed unused variables

        + Remove unnecessary comments

      - liblines is now compiled as liblines.so

      - liblines now supports writing coordinate points to a file

      - liblines has temporary disabled Pythagorean Theorem code

      - The LinearGraphFunctions class no longer exists. Its functions,
        however, still exist.

      - Added a new function that returns the version number. The
        version number has been defined by a macro.

      - liblines now detects what OS you are using. This helps with many things,
        including file paths, running external programs, etc.

    * Massive changes, including:

      - Compared to 1.2, command and option handling have been massively
        improved. There will be more improvements later on.
        
      - Lines properly treats unknown commands as unknown commands.

      - Some core functionallity has been moved to a new header named
        "lines.hpp".

      - Instead of using multiple "if" statements to do an action based on
        the user's option, there are now "if" and "else if" statements.


    * Thanks to liblines v2.0, a new option to write coordinate points
      has been added. This is option 4.

    * The single coordinate point generator is now Option 5.

    * There is now an installer. However, that's a work in progress. This
      installer does borrow a bit of Lines code as well.

    * Tweaked main screen to reflect new application name. For some
      reason, I haven't done that when I started calling this
      application Lines (at least, I think this hasn't been done before).

    * The About screen is no longer an option. It is now a command. Type
      "about" to access the about screen.
      
    * Updated the About screen.

    * Similar to option 3, you can generate a coordinate point using a
      number. This works better with negative numbers and decimals
      compared to the other generator. It's sort of like a temporary
      resolution to the other generator until I get to test it.

    * When solving for the graph's equation, y-intercept, and slope ,
      internal multiplying, subtracting, and dividing functions are no
      longer used. This is because of how those functions were removed
      and are no longer available.

    * Due to an issue that was caused by something else and NOT by Lines
      or liblines, I've rewritten the code reponsible for solving the
      equation, slope, and Y-Intercept using 2 coordinate points and the
      code that is responsible for solving the equation and Y-Intercept
      using the slope and one coordinate point. Here are the advantages:

      - It's easier to understand than before

      - Unnecessary variables have been removed

      - Variables are now easier to understand

      - Added support for the proper formatting for the equation. It's
        not complete, but you'll see that soon.

    * Added experimental log file support. Log files will be usually saved in
      /tmp/lines on Unix and Unix-like systems.

    * Added new command: clear. This command is simple: it clears the screen

    * Change the "quit" command to "exit". The functionallity it no different
      than the quit command.

    **The HTML version is still under development. I'm working on it!**

=================================
1.x
=================================

v1.0:
    * Initial Release:

      - You can calculate an equation, the slope, and y-intercept using
        two coordinate points.

      - Though not implemented yet, there is an option to calculate an
        equation and y-intercept using the slope and one coordinate
        point. This option returns a message saying that the option is
        unimplemented and will be added soon.

v1.1:

    * Updated libcalc (formerly the calculator.hpp file) to version 1.1.

        - Added support for calculating an equation using the slope and
          a coordinate point.

        - Added support for calculating exponents

        - Added experimental Pythagorean Theorem support. You can find a
          missing side of a triangle with one side and the hypotenuse.
          NOTE: Untested

        - absolute_value and squqare_root() no longer output their
          answers. You must do this yourself.

    * Option 2 is now available thanks to libcalc

    * Added new about screen (option 3)

    * Options are now treated as a string and not a number

    **Though option 2 may be implemented, I cannot guarantee accuracy**

v1.2:
    Before we get to the release notes, I would like to say that this
    would've been the last version of Lines. However, during a live
    stream on my YouTube channel, I noticed that the y-intercept and the
    format of the equation were incorrect.

    Because of that issue, I've decided to release Lines v1.2.1,
    officially the last version of the Lines v1.x series. Lines v1.2.1
    has an updated algorithm that solves the y-intercept and displays
    the equation correctly. This comes from v2.0. After this change,
    there will not be any more updates to the Lines v1.x series. No
    more. NONE.
    
    * Updated libcalc to version 1.2.
        - Added support for generating coordinate points using the slope
          and y-intercept

        - Changed the Linear class name LinearGraphFunctions

    * Thanks to libcalc v1.2, thereâ€™s a new coordinate point generator.
      Just type in the y-intercept, slope, and the amount of coordinate
      points you want (this will also be used for x). This will be
      option 3

    * The About Screen is now option 4

v1.2.1:
    ** Originally, v1.2 was supposed to be the last version of the Lines v1.x
       series. However, I've decided to correct the formatting when displaying
       the equation**.

    * Fixed formating when displaying an equation for a graph
