# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Below is a table with supported versions of Lines:

| Version  | Supported          |
| -------- | ------------------ |
| v3.x     | Yes                |
| v2.x     | Yes                |
| < v2.0.1 | No                 |

Usually, the current supported branch will get security updates, new features, bug fixes, and more. The previous branch will still be supported, but only with security updates and, if necessary, with bug fixes. For example, let's say that the latest version is v3.1.2. This means that v3.x and v2.x branches are still supported. However, the v2.x series of Lines is only supported with security updates and only necessary bug fixes.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability in Lines, go ahead and [open an issue](https://github.com/generic-pers0n/lines/issues/new/choose) **as soon as possible**. Make sure you mark your issue with the `security` tag and other appropriate tags. The sooner an issue is opened, the faster Lines can get updated with a security patch.

Updates regarding security in Lines will be patched as soon as possible, but **this does not mean immiediately**. I'll try to patch them as soon as I can have the time, but they may not make it.

Usually, a security issue will be accepted, unless it has been marked with the following tags:

* `duplicate`
* `invalid`
* `wontfix`

If your issue has been marked with `legacy`, then this means that your issue relates to an unsupported (legacy) version of Lines. This issue will not be accepted and will be closed.
