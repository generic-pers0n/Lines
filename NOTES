Before you are able to run Lines on Unix and so, you need to run this command:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/Lines/src

Also, if you want to install Lines, be sure to install liblines (liblines.so)
to /usr/lib/liblines and Lines to /usr/bin on UNIX or UNIX-like systems (macOS,
Linux, FreeBSD, etc.).

When compiling Lines from source, you'll need to install liblines first. Then
you can compile Lines. I'll figure out something to remove this limitation
some time soon.

On Windows, I don't recommend using Lines at all as though there is more
compatibility with UNIX and UNIX-like systems at this time. However, I'll work
on more Windows compatibility soon. If you want to install and use Lines anyway,
install Lines to C:\Program Files\Lines or C:\Program Files (x64)\Lines for
the 64 bit version of Lines*.

* I do no provide any Windows binaries, so you'll need to compile Lines yourself
to get these binaries.
