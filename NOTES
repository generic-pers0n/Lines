Before you are able to run Lines on Unix and so, you need to run this command:
export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=/path/to/Lines/src

Also, if you want to install Lines, be sure to install liblines (liblines.so)
to /usr/lib/liblines and Lines to /usr/bin on UNIX or UNIX-like systems (macOS,
Linux, FreeBSD, etc.).

On Windows, I don't recommend using Lines at all as though there is more
compatibility with UNIX and UNIX-like systems at this time. However, I'll work
on more Windows compatibility in Lines v2.1. If you want to install and use
Lines anyway, install Lines to C:\Program Files\Lines or
C:\Program Files (x64)\Lines for the 64 bit version of Lines*.

*I do no provide any Windows binaries, so you'll need to compile Lines yourself
to get these binaries.
