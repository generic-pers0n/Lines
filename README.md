### What is Lines?
Lines is a basic calculator that calculates the slope, y-intercept, and equation for a linear graph. However, Lines can do many more things too.

### Features
* You can find a graph's equation, y-intercept, and slope using two coordinate points
* You can find a graph's equation and y-intercept using the slope and one coordinate point
* You can generate coordinate points (see the Notes below)

### Notes
1. For generating coordinate points, you'll have 3 options.

### License
Right now, I'm not sure what license Lines should be licensed under. I'm thinking of using the [GPL v3 License](https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.html).
