# Lines
The Swiss Army Knife for linear graphs.

**NOTE: Lines is NOT  graphing calculator. It does not make a graph using an equation from your answer or by inputting one in the calculator.** 

# What is Lines
Lines is a basic calculator that calculates the slope, y-intercept, and equation for a linear graph. However, Lines can do many more things too. 

# System Requirements
* Lines is guaranteed to work on Linux **and** Windows
* Lines could work on other systems, provided boost is installed
* The binaries provided are 64-bit only 

# Features
* You can find a graph's equation, y-intercept, and slope using two coordinate points 
* You can find a graph's equation and y-intercept using the slope and one coordinate point
* You can generate coordinate points 2 different ways. More information is can be found at the Wiki.
