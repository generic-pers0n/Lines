# Contributing

**NOTE: This is a work in progress. Not everything is completed.**

With the availability of the source code of Lines on GitHub comes the opportunity to contribute to Lines. However, when you contribute, you agree to these guidelines. The following guidelines are shown below.

**NOTE: You do NOT need to know how to code in order for you to contribute to Lines.**

## Branches
You'll see several branches in the Lines repository: `master`, `devel`, and `beta`. The `master` branch is the source code for the latest version of Lines. **DO NOT CONTRIBUTE DIRECTLY TO THIS BRANCH UNLESS OTHERWISE TOLD.** This is what the other branch, `devel`, is for. `devel` is for any changes of any kind, whether that's for Lines, liblines, or any documentation.

The `beta` branch is similar to the `devel` branch. However, this is for more stable releases of Lines, but aren't complete. If, for example, you added a feature and you want it to be included in the Lines beta, then it will be included in the `beta` branch. However, it **does not** mean that your feature will be included in the final release.

If you want to create your own seperate branch for a feature you are proposing, then it will be reviewed. For the most part, some features or changes will always be accepted, but this doesn't mean that all features will be accepted. During the review, anybody can contribute to that branch, but only if it's related to that feature.

### Pull Requests
When there's a branch that's ready to be merged, you can go ahead and start a pull request. When you do, we'll review all the changes there is to look at. If approved, then your pull request may come to life.

**NOTE: If your pull request gets accepted, and your pull request is about merging the** `beta` **branch into the** `master` **branch, then that indicates you want to release a new version of Lines.**

## Documentation
If you want to change something about the documentation, then you can go ahead and contribute. You'll need to know some Markdown, which is extremely easy to learn (at least, the standard implementation is). To learn Markdown, visit [this link](https://www.markdowntutorial.com/).
