## A Note
If you are interested in contributing to Lines, I thank you for wanting to contribute to Lines, but at this time, I'm not accepting contributions to code or documentation (see more below). Below is an in progress contributing guide that shows you about the various things that go on here in the development of Lines.

Finally, code contributions I won't accept until Lines v4.0, but documentation I will accept soon. I plan on licensing the documentation under some appropriate license (at this time, I'm going towards CC-BY 4.0 or CC-BY-SA 4.0). If you want to suggest another license, feel free to create an issue on it, but please be sure that it allows for redistribution, copying, and that it's compatible with the GPL verison 3 (the license that Lines and liblines are licensed under).

Below this the in-progress contributing guide.

Welcome to the Lines community! I'm very glad that you've decided to contribute to Lines, whether that be to Lines itself or to it's documentation. Regardless, I accept contributions to both documentation and code. Even if you don't know how to code, **you do NOT need to know how to code to contribute to Lines**.
